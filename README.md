# Java Web Planet

This is the repository of **Java Web Planet**, a simple web MVC.

It is abbreviated "**jawn**", which is a homophone of "yawn", as this project is supposed to be so simple to use
that you can do it almost do it your sleep.

# Documentation
* [Getting started](docs/getting_started.md)
* [Structure of a jawn project](docs/structure_of_jawn_project.md)
* [Controllers](docs/controllers.md)


This started out a fork of [ActiveWeb](https://github.com/javalite/activeweb),
but it has moved pretty far away from the original way of thinking of ActiveWeb
when it comes to handling URLs, writing controllers and the inner workings.
Also the notion of setting a controller to be RESTful has been removed.

When this is said, however, much of the usage is the same, so is should be
seamless to migrate from one to the other.
