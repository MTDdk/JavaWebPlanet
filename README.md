**java-web-planet** strives to be a simple library for web MVC development. 

It is abbreviated "**jawn**", which is a homophone of "yawn", as this project is supposed to be so simple to use
that you can do it almost in your sleep.

## Documentation
Head over to the **[wiki](https://github.com/MTDdk/jawn/wiki)** for a thorough walk-through.
